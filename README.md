#Fall 2016 CMPE 133 Project -- net[work]

This is just a sameple project that you can pull from git, install locally, and run on local machine.
By successfully cloning this repo and running the tutorial sample app on your local machine, this will mean you have set up and install all the needed components with the exception of MongoDB which i still need to fiure out how to use/set up.
@Nav or @Ash if you have time maybe you can help with this since you have experience with mongoDB
